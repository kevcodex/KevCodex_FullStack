# iOS Partner App to Server
An app for demo-ing some features I've used. It shows some of my favorite video games in no particular order. This app was made without any external frameworks or third party libraries. This app uses networking to pull in data from a JSON file which is parsed and displayed on a collection view. It has a custom transition to show the details. The app uses auto layout so it can be viewed vertically or horizontally and will adjust cell size appropriately.

JSON Data is now pulled from a server side swift project at [kevcodex.com](http://kevcodex.com). At this website, I can modify the list of favorite games. The code for the website can be found on bitbucket [HERE](https://bitbucket.org/kevcodex/kevcodex).

Feel free to look at or use the code. :)
